WE USE THIS TYPESCRIPT SUBPROJECT TO PRODUCE THE RUNTIME LUA FILES  
YOU DON'T NEED TO CARE ABOUT THIS AND IT MIGHT NOT BUILD FOR YOU (WE USE A MODIFIED VERSION OF OUR TYPESCRIPT LIB THAT ALSO ONLY CONTAINS THE DECLARATIONS)  
YOU CAN FIND THE BUILT LUA FILES IN THE RESOURCES OF THE SIMPLE IMPLEMENTATION
